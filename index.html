  <h1>Writing Assignment 1 - Software Design</h1>
  <p>Software Design is an integral part of creating a software product. Software design is the process of taking a problem, 
    finding what needs to be fixed or "gathering reuirements", and then creating a plan for building software that meets those
    requirements. Spending time designing your software makes the building process exponentially easier.</p>
  <h2>The Software Development Process</h2>
  <p>The software development process is the process that every software product has to go through to ensure quality. Many people believe
      that software development only includes programming but this couldn't be further from the truth. Programming and implementation, while many
      do agree is the most dificult, is one section of the software development process. There are 5 sections every software should go through 
      during development:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Requirement Gathering</li>
    <li>Design Stage</li>
    <li>Implementation</li>
    <li>Verification</li>
    <li>Maintenence</li></li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Why is Software Design Even Important?</h2>
  <p>Software Design is extremely important as computers now adays are everywhere, and it is extremely important that the software that computer
      users are interacting with are easy to use and to understand. Not everone is extremely gifted and capable of understanding how to use a computer which is
      why it is important to carefully go through all aspects of the design process to create a user friendly experience. Rushing into implementation can make programmers lose
      track of certain things and overall creates messy software products. This reflects thrugh the workplace as Programming as a skill on its own is no longer enough for most 
      jobs.</p>

  <h2>An Example of Well Designed Software</h2>
  <p>The first piece of software that comes to mind is the IOS system software. Personally this is my favourite system software in phones for a few reasons. The first being the
      usability. IOS is extremely easy to navigate and understand. They have modes for everyone whether you're not tech savy, and even if you're extremely well versed with computers.
      Another aspect about IOS i value is its ecosystem. All Apple products are easy to connect with each other and communicate well with one another. This provides a feeling of
      wholistic software which only makes life easier.</p>
  <h2>What is Requirements Gathering??</h2>
  <p>
    During the initial phase of requirements gathering, various integral figures in the development process such as developers, 
    end-users, and project managers collaborate to establish an understanding of the software project's objectives, desired functions, and limitations. 
    This involves collecting detailed information about user needs and carefully documenting them in order to
      create a comprehensive plan for the development stages. The significance of this stage cannot be overstated as 
     it establishes a common ground among all parties involved.  Accurate requirements play an essential role in guiding the 
    development team towards meeting user expectations effectively. By providing precise specifications upfront, potential 
       misunderstandings can be minimized significantly which helps prevent costly revisions or delays during later phases of development.
    Moreover, well-defined requirements serve as a solid foundation for making informed decisions throughout the entire software
    development process. They facilitate effective communication between stakeholders while also reducing risks and enhancing overall project efficiency.
        In essence, one could compare the importance of the requirements gathering stage to meticulously planning out every detail before embarking on a journey.
      Just like how a detailed roadmap defines both destination and optimal route selection contributes greatly toward successful navigation; similarly thorough 
    requirement analysis ensures timely delivery without compromising product quality.

  <h2>Examples of User Stories for Discord (ios too broad)</h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
   <li> As a user, I want a frequently asked questions forum, so that i dont have to call a help centre to ask a question.</li>
    <li>  As a user, I want a block feature, so that i dont have to interact with people i dont want to.</li>
   <li>   As a blind user, I want more accesibility features for the blind, so that i can use the software more efficiently.</li>
    <li>  As a female user, I want an identity verification feature, so that i dont have to worry about if i am speaking to a crazy ex.</li>
    <li>  As a younger user, I want a feature that separates users by age, so that i can feel safe talking to people my own age.</li>
    </ul>
